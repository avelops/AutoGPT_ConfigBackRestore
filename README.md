# AutoGPT_ConfigBackRestore
A Python based GUI that when pointed at the "AutoGPT" folder containing the "AI_Settings.yaml" will be able to create backups of the file and keep multiple backups each name is the "ai_name" given, that way you can keep multiple configurations for use with AutoGPT

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the main.py file.
Run the script by executing the command python main.py.
This will launch the GUI application, and you can interact with it to select a folder, create backups, show available backups, and restore backups.

Please make sure you have Python installed on your system, as well as the necessary dependencies mentioned in the code (such as tkinter). If any dependencies are missing, you may need to install them using pip before running the script.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
